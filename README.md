# Race Day --Conditional Statement
Here’s how our registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.

Race number:

    Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
    All others receive a number below 1000.

Start time:

    Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
        Early adults run at 9:30 am.
        Late adults run at 11:00 am.
    Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).

# Sleep Debt Calculator --Functions

Did you know that giraffes sleep 4.6 hours a day? We humans need more than that. If we don’t sleep enough, we accumulate sleep debt. In this project we’ll calculate if you’re getting enough sleep each week using a sleep debt calculator.

The program will determine the actual and ideal hours of sleep for each night of the last week.

Finally, it will calculate, in hours, how far you are from your weekly sleep goal.

# Training Days --Scope
As a seasoned athlete, one of your favorite activities is running marathons. You use a service called Training Days that sends you a message for the event you signed up for and the days you have left to train.

Since you also code, Training Days has asked you to help them solve a problem: The program currently uses the wrong scope for its variables. They know this can be troublesome as their service evolves. In this project you will make Training Days more maintainable and less error-prone by fixing variable scopes.
